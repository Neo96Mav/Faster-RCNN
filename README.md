# Faster-RCNN
Project for EE769 Machine Learning
Authors : Avineil Jain, Sravan Patchala 

# Code Structure 
1) train.py creates, trains the model and stores it 
2) test_frcnn.py tests the model "my_frcnn_try.hdf5" from test and saves it to test_results folder
3) keras_frcnn contains the various functions used

# Note
The model has only been trained for 15% of its training time due to constraints of time and computation. However, since it produces decent results, we decided to stop training and add it to the repo. The main purpose of the project was NOT to beat some benchmarks, but to learn and understand object detection and implement a state-of-the-art technique for it! :)
